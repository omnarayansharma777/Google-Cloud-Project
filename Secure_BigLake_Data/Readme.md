# Challenge scenario

You are asked to help a newly formed development team with some of their initial work on a new project. 
Specifically, they need a new BigLake table from a Cloud Storage file with the appropriate permissions to limit access to sensitive data columns; 
you receive the following request to complete the following tasks:

1. Create a BigLake table from an existing file on Cloud Storage.
2. Apply and verify policy tags to restrict access to columns containing sensitive data.
3. Remove direct IAM permissions to Cloud Storage for other users (after policy tags have been applied to protect the data).
